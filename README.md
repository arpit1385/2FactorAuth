# 2FactorAuth
A simple 2 factor authentication program based on python3.
This authenticator is lightweight and operating system independent.
It might look similar as any other authenticator but is more reliable as instead of local time it depends on real time for generation for tokens.
This still works offline and it stores the data in .json format for reading and writing easily while it is a huge issue, I am still working on it.
